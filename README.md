## API Integration

The app currently uses simulated data for demonstration. To integrate real APIs:

### YouTube Data API
- Get API key from Google Cloud Console
- Implement video search and metadata fetching

### Reddit API
- Register Reddit app for API access
- Implement post search and community browsing

### Other Platforms
- Instagram Graph API (requires business account)
- Facebook Graph API
- Twitter API v2

## Design Philosophy

**Focus Search** is built on the principle that users should be able to find what they're looking for without being distracted by algorithmic recommendations. The app provides:

- **Intentional Search** - Users choose what to search for
- **Clean Results** - No ads, recommendations, or suggested content
- **Platform Flexibility** - Search across multiple platforms from one interface
- **Modern UI** - Beautiful glass morphism design that feels native to iOS

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real API integration for all platforms
- [ ] Search history and favorites
- [ ] Advanced filtering options
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] iPad optimization
- [ ] Search suggestions and autocomplete
- [ ] Offline result caching
